It allows users to\n            access various features, such as sending messages, creating group\n            chats, and participating in secure voice calls. By using their\n            Ethereum wallets, users can maintain their anonymity while engaging\n            in various forms of communication. The decentralized chat\n            application harnesses the power of Ethereum's smart contract\n            technology and SHXDXW tokens to create a secure and private\n            environment for users. Instead of requiring users to pay tokens for\n            each communication, the platform simply mandates that users hold a\n            specific amount of SHXDXW tokens in their Ethereum wallets to access\n            and use the chat application. This approach makes the platform more\n            accessible and cost-effective while still maintaining its core\n            features and benefits. Once users meet the minimum SHXDXW token\n            holding requirement, they can freely communicate with others on the\n            platform. The smart contract technology processes each interaction,\n            encrypting messages and ensuring complete privacy and security. The\n            encrypted messages are then broadcasted to the recipient's Ethereum\n            wallet, providing a seamless and secure communication experience.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <br></br>\n        <div className=\"square\">\n          <p className=\"textMain\">\n            Total Supply With a finite total supply of 100,000,000 tokens on the\n            Ethereum blockchain, SHXDXW is a deflationary cryptocurrency\n            designed for long-term growth potential. The team is committed to\n            buying back and burning tokens over time, ensuring a continuously\n            decreasing supply and increased scarcity. Tax Fee SHXDXW implements\n            a 4% tax fee on both buying and selling transactions, ensuring a\n            steady source of funding for marketing, development, and strategic\n            partnerships. This tax structure supports the project's ongoing\n            growth and contributes to its long-term success in the dynamic\n            crypto landscape. Token Limits SHXDXW ensures fairness by\n            implementing a 2% maximum transaction limit and a 4% maximum wallet\n            limit. These measures prevent early investors from dominating the\n            supply, promoting a more equitable distribution of tokens for\n            participants entering the market around the same time. \n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default App;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
