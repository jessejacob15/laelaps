It allows users to access various features, such as sending messages, creating group chats, and participating in secure voice calls. By using their Ethereum wallets, users can maintain their anonymity while engaging in various forms of communication. The decentralized chat application harnesses the power of Ethereum's smart contract technology and SHXDXW tokens to create a secure and private environment for users. Instead of requiring users to pay tokens for each communication, the platform simply mandates that users hold a specific amount of SHXDXW tokens in their Ethereum wallets to access and use the chat application. This approach makes the platform more accessible and cost-effective while still maintaining its core features and benefits. Once users meet the minimum SHXDXW token holding requirement, they can freely communicate with others on the platform. The smart contract technology processes each interaction, encrypting messages and ensuring complete privacy and security. The encrypted messages are then broadcasted to the recipient's Ethereum wallet, providing a seamless and secure communication experience."})}),Object(u.jsx)("br",{}),Object(u.jsx)("div",{className:"square",children:Object(u.jsx)("p",{className:"textMain",children:"Total Supply With a finite total supply of 100,000,000 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, SHXDXW is a deflationary cryptocurrency designed for long-term growth potential. The team is committed to buying back and burning tokens over time, ensuring a continuously decreasing supply and increased scarcity. Tax Fee SHXDXW implements a 4% tax fee on both buying and selling transactions, ensuring a steady source of funding for marketing, development, and strategic partnerships. This tax structure supports the project's ongoing growth and contributes to its long-term success in the dynamic crypto landscape. Token Limits SHXDXW ensures fairness by implementing a 2% maximum transaction limit and a 4% maximum wallet limit. These measures prevent early investors from dominating the supply, promoting a more equitable distribution of tokens for participants entering the market around the same time."})})]})}}]),a}(s.a.Component),p=d;c.a.render(Object(u.jsx)(s.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(u.jsx)(p,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[17,1,2]]]);
